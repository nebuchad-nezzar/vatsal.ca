## Intro
The concept of the underlying asset is fundamental to understanding derivative markets. An underlying asset is the financial instrument upon which derivatives such as options and futures contracts are based. This can include a wide range of assets, from stocks and bonds to commodities and currencies. The value and performance of these derivatives are directly linked to their underlying assets, making them crucial for traders and investors alike. In this blog, we will examine the role of underlying assets in financial markets, their impact on trading strategies, and how they contribute to effective risk management. By gaining a deeper understanding of underlying assets, investors can enhance their decision-making processes and better navigate the complexities of the market.
The equities are perphaps the most familiar of the asset class. The shareholder capital or stock of a comapny represents the capital paid into ot invested in business by the shareholders for instance. The capital have different type of classes of equity.

## What is a Commodity?
Any marketable item produce to satisfy wants or needs and this can include goods and services.
Commodities are generally have high traded derivaitve market while the spot market tend to be less liquid. The most active derivative market are commodity futures exchanges in the USA and UK, although the first real future marketwas probably the rice market that began in the seventeenth-century Osaka, Japan. Spot market provide for the the immediate delivery of the relevant commodity while derivative market provide for or accomadate deliveryat some point in the future.
These market help to determine the 'world' prices although most transaction in commodities dont actually takes place 'on market'. Instead bilateral arrangements undertaken directly between the buyer and the and a seller. The prices at which these trades takes place are generally not made in public, since they are private transactions, but they tend to be determine to some extent in the reference to the prices traded on the market.

The main participants in the commodity marketare producers (mining companies, farmers, refiners, oil companies etc.), manufacturers. Other commodities that are traded on the market are the ones who have gone through some refining before they are traded includes gasoline and fuel oil(both are derived from crude oil), sugar, corn etc. In the case of crude oil, goverments sometime are also involved in the maniplation of the price in the case of OPEC.
Although they are lumped together into one single header, but their prices behave differentlyand they are influnced by commodity-specific factors. Gold prices will be impacted by the festive season in India, oil prices by the driving season in the USA. Point is, as the global economy expands, we can assume that prices of the will rise but the path of prices will be heavily dependent on the forces of nature.

## What is Hedging?
Producers and consumers of commodities will use derivatives markets to hedge their future production or consumption. Producers will want to lock in their pricesof their future output so that they have certainity of revenue. This certainity is required since their capital spending requirements are enormous and spread out over many years. Likewise, consumers will look into to lock in the supply of raw materials over time since they will not risk bot being able to find the materials they need to manufacture their goods. This is hedging.

## Option Pricing 
Options time preimum 
In the money (ITM)-

Out the money (OTM)-
An option price is made out of 2 parts, ie intrinsic and extrinsic 


Let's first take a step back and look at payoff diagrams and construct a portfolio made up of a long call option at 100 and a short put option on the same 100 dollar strike. If we look at the payoffs at expiry, they are exactly the same as buying the underlying asset. No matter where the underlying finishes at expiry, we will be buying a future at price $100. For example, if the future finishes at $105, our long call will be worth $5, since it's $5 in the money, and we will exercise the right to buy the future for a price of $100, which is equivalent to buying the future at price $100 and realizing that $5 profit from it now being at $105. 
Since we can construct a position from a call and a put that behaves like an underlying asset, there must be a mathematical link between the prices of the call and the put such that when combined to create the synthetic asset, their prices are equivalent to that of purchasing the underlying. Otherwise, someone could take advantage of a price discrepancy between these three instruments, call, put, and underlying, and trade all three to lock in some risk-free profit. We call this arbitrage.

The idea here is to show how the combination of a long call and a short put at the same strike price can mimic the payoff of owning the underlying asset directly. This concept is crucial in options pricing and leads us to the put-call parity relationship, which helps ensure that arbitrage opportunities are minimized in the market, aka Synthetic Asset Arbitrage Strategy.
