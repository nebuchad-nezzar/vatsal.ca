I love using admonitions in Obsidian and I wanted to bring that same feel to my blogging experience. I have created more than 10 different admonition types with an optional title prop and the ability to nest admonitions. Check out some of them below:

## Warning
<Box
    text="**Warning**: Something that tells you to be careful or tells you about something, usually something bad, before it happens."
    type="warning"
/>

## Caution
<Box
    text="**Caution**:Great care, because of possible danger; to warn somebody not to do something."
    type="caution"
/>
## Summary
<Box
    text="**summary**:For the conclusion and all the TLDRs;"
    type="summary"
/>
## Comment
<Box
    text="**Comment**:A criticism or interpretation, often by implication or suggestion; to write explanatory or critical notes upon a text."
    type="comment"
/>

## Question
<Box
    text="**Question**:A sentence in an interrogative form, addressed to someone in order to get information in reply."
    type="question"
/>

## Tip
<Box
    text="**Tip**:A small piece of useful advice about something practical."
    type="tip"
/>



## Quote
<Box
    text="**Quote**:To repeat (a passage, phrase, etc.) from a book, speech, or the like, as by way of authority, illustration, etc."
    type="quote"
/>



## Docs
<Box
    text="**Docs**:Manuals, listings, diagrams, and other hard- or soft-copy written and graphic materials that describe the use, operation, maintenance, or design of software or hardware."
    type="definition"
/>
## Note
<Box
    text="**Note**:A brief record of something written down to assist the memory or for future reference; a record or outline of a speech, statement, testimony, etc."
    type="info"
/>

## Important
<Box
    text="**important**:Having great value or influence; very necessary; (used about a person) having great influence or authority."
    type="theorem"
/>


## Admointions supports codeblocks
<Box
    text="**Warning**:Please keep in mind that the servers, we're talking about here are database servers.
    ```py
    def fibonacci_memoization(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fibonacci_memoization(n-1, memo) + fibonacci_memoization(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]

n = 10
fib_sequence = [fibonacci_memoization(i) for i in range(n)]
print(fib_sequence)
    ```"
