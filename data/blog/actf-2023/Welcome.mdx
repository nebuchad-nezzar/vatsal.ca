I have been toying with the idea of starting up a new blog for quite a while but school has kept me occupied and the plans were
constantly pushed back. Last year, I was bored with my previous version of my website. So, decided to renovate the the look and feel of it.
I have shifted from Javascript to typescript and ShadCN for UI.

With school winding up, I began to explore ways to document and share my thoughts. I guess reaching the end of my formal education
pathway made me aware of how easy it is to just go on with the flow of life, stop questioning, stop thinking. So here's my attempt to
fight against that inertia, to stay critically engaged and curious. Anyway, I have always enjoyed discussing nitty grity details on
empirical research and this blog seems like a natural extension to it.

I hope to use this platform to document most of my research projects and experiments coding in C++, Python and Javascript. The ever
increasing number of user-written R packages makes it such a flexible platform to conduct analysis and publish results, and has made me
an R convert. Content wise here are some stuff I plan to write about:


- Projects I have worked on.
- Quant Finance
- Data science and Machine learning
- Software Engineering
- Programming

Ok, the last category intentionally keeps my options fairly open but we shall see how it evolves down the road. In the meantime please
excuse the messiness and constant changes. I am still playing around with some features but let me know if you have any thoughts on the
content or what you would like to see. Meanwhile...

```python
print("Hello World")
