        'Built a video surveillance system based on the SSD MobileNet architecture, utilizing centroid tracking for object detection. The system logs all data into a separate Excel file and includes IP camera configuration capabilities. I deployed various algorithms, including RCNN, YOLOv4, DeepSort, and RetinaNet, and compared their performance during the research phase. The system provides real-time alerts via email, ensuring timely notifications. Notably, I achieved a frame rate of 51-64 FPS on the CPU, showcasing the efficiency of the implementation. This project highlights my ability to integrate advanced computer vision techniques for effective surveillance solutions.',
