By incorporating a security token mechanism, the proposed method ensures reliable and singular transaction processing despite network issues or rapid clicks. The study highlights the importance of compliance with RBI regulations and the impact on users, banks, and issuers. Results demonstrate a significant reduction in duplicate transactions, improving transaction reliability and business efficiency.",
