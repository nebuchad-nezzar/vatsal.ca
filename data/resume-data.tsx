			"Developed and implemented advanced algorithms and software solutions tailored for industrial applications, with a strong focus on enhancing efficiency and precision in automated systems. I designed a robust color detection algorithm that significantly improved the accuracy of color sorting processes, even under varying lighting conditions. Additionally, I created a custom log counting algorithm that streamlined data processing, reducing processing time by 90% and eliminating labor costs. Leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques, I built a pattern recognition model that achieved a 96% improvement in detection and classification accuracy. I also engineered standalone software deployable on NVIDIA GPUs, such as Jetson, and Intel NCS, enabling advanced computational tasks and integrating with drones for enhanced functionality. These experiences demonstrate my ability to deliver innovative technical solutions that address real-world industrial challenges and drive operational efficiency.",

Notably, the model I contributed to was stress-tested during Hurricane Irma in 2017, providing valuable insights into its performance under extreme conditions. I gained hands-on experience in risk assessment and insurance, performing feature engineering and cleaning raw data to improve model accuracy. Leveraging tools such as NumPy, pandas, Plotly, and scikit-learn, I developed algorithms and created insightful data visualizations using Python, further enhancing decision-making capabilities within the team.",
